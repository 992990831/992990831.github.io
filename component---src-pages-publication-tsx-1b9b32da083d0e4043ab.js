The FES patients underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months of treatment. For 1H-MRS, the concentrations of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate + glutamine in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex region were measured.
